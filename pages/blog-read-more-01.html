                <p>Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another. While this might seem pretty straightforward, it involves a change in storage and database or application. In the context of the extract/transform/load (ETL) process, any data migration will involve at least the transform and load steps.
                  The Freelancer by Contently is a portfolio website specifically for freelance writers and journalists. In addition to serving as your online portfolio, it can serve as a place to find work and connect directly with clients. Here are its top three compelling features: <br> <br>
                  It uses a simple and single-page portfolio interface where you can display an unlimited number of projects or blog posts. 
                  Potential clients can filter projects based on the clients you’ve worked with, topics and skills, which are great for writers that work in multiple industries. 
                  Freelancers with professional experience might even be contacted for freelance opportunities with clients like Marriott, Microsoft and Walmart. <br>
                  Cool Feature: Contently has a rates database so you can see what other freelancers earn, and a freelance rates calculator to help you determine the amount you should charge for each client. 

                  Free version: Yes! It’s free for writers. (Clients pay to tap into that network.)</p>
